### Project Overview
This project is a User Management System built using React. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user records. The application fetches initial data from the JSONPlaceholder API and provides functionality for managing user data, such as adding, editing, and deleting users.


### Directory Structure
public: Contains the root index.html file and other public assets.
src: Where all React code lives.
components: Contains React components (e.g., App.js, UserList.js, UserForm.js).
index.js: Main entry point for React.
styles/: Contains the CSS or Bootstrap styles used in the application (if applicable).

### Components

### App.js
The main component that holds the application logic and state (if using hooks).
Fetches user data from JSONPlaceholder and stores it in state.
Passes down props to UserList and UserForm.

### UserList.js
Displays the list of users in a table (or list) format.
Handles inline editing or communicates with App.js to update or delete users.
Shows “Edit” and “Delete” buttons for each user.

### UserForm.js
Contains a form for adding new users or editing existing users.
Accepts props to handle form submission, resetting fields, etc.

### ErrorBoundary.js
A component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree and displays a fallback UI. 

### Challenges Faced

### Data Persistence:
Since JSONPlaceholder doesn’t persist new data, we had to simulate adding and editing users by only updating local React state.

### ID Generation:
We needed a strategy for creating unique IDs without conflicting with random IDs fetched from JSONPlaceholder. We addressed this by calculating a highest ID or generating random IDs.

### Inline Editing vs. Separate Form:
Deciding between an inline editing approach or a separate form required careful management of component state and props.

### Error Handling:
Ensuring robust error handling while fetching data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displaying user-friendly error messages.
Capturing and rendering errors gracefully without affecting user experience.

### Dynamic Data Binding:
Keeping the state consistent between form and list required careful synchronization.

### Form Validation:
Ensuring all fields are filled correctly before submission. 

### Key Features
Fetch users from an external API.
Add new users to the list.
Edit existing users' details.
Delete users from the list.
Inline editing with validation.
Error handling using ErrorBoundary.
Notifications using react-toastify. 

### Potential Improvements

### Form Validation:
Use a library like Formik or Yup for robust and scalable form validation.
### Styling:
Replace Bootstrap with a modern CSS framework like TailwindCSS for a more streamlined UI.
### State Management:
Integrate Redux or Context API for more efficient state management in larger applications.
### API Integration:
Connect the app with a real backend for persistent data storage instead of using a mock API.
### Testing:
Add unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library for better code reliability.

### Technologies Used
React
Bootstrap for styling
React Toastify for notifications
JSONPlaceholder API for mock user data
